# Overview:

Facial recognition technology has witnessed remarkable advancements, especially in the domain of identifying actors and actresses in the entertainment industry. 
This research delves into the realm of facial recognition technology, particularly in identifying actors and actresses via Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. The study revolves around a vast dataset encompassing facial images of actors and actresses from diverse backgrounds and demographics, employing feature extraction methods to isolate pertinent facial attributes.

The four machine learning models undergo training using this comprehensive dataset. SVM utilizes kernel-based classification, CNN leverages convolutional layers for image recognition, Random Forest harnesses decision trees, and Logistic Regression models binary outcomes based on input features.

The performance evaluation utilizes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess each algorithm's efficacy. Initial findings indicate SVM's superiority in accuracy and generalization over CNN and Random Forest. However, Logistic Regression exhibits competitive performance with reduced computational complexity compared to CNN. Surprisingly, CNN's efficacy lags in this specific dataset, an unexpected observation.

This thorough analysis unveils the strengths and limitations of SVM, CNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest in actor facial recognition tasks. These findings hold promise for refining facial recognition systems within the entertainment industry and various applications, potentially enhancing identification and authentication mechanisms significantly.
